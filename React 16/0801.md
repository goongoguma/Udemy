* What is React? </br>
-> A *JavaScript Library* for building *User Interfaces(components)*</br>

* Why React?</br>
-> UI State becomes difficult to handle with Vanila JavaScript</br>
-> Focus on business logic, not on preventing your App from exploding (furthermore, framwork creators probably write better code)</br>
-> Huge ecosystem, active community, high performance</br>

* Two Kinds of App</br>
 - Single Page Applications</br>
 -> Only one HTML page, content is (re)rendered on client</br>
 -> Typically only one ReactDom.render().call</br>
 - Multi Page Applications</br>
 -> Multiple HTML Pages, content is rendered on server</br>
 -> One ReactDOM.render() call per 'widget'</br>
