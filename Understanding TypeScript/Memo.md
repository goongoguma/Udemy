## 1. What is TypeScript?

- _TypeScript is a wrapper so to say it compiles down to Javascript_ in the end and introduces new features which we can use in our code and which will then run in the browser as the TypeScript compiler will make sure to find ways to compile all these great new features into ES5 code to then run in any browser.
- _The most important feature is that TypeScript is that strongly typed language_ which means you have to be specific which type of variable is
- So that you can't have a string variable and then assign a number to it and get through with it.
- _TypeScript is only an extra language we can use during development, it is not what runs in the browser._
- Easy to say, 타입스크립트 : 코드를 실행하기전 타입관련 문제를 찾아낼 수 있는 기술.

## 2. Why TypeScript and How to use it?

- We simply mix our TS code with JS code, any degree of mixture is possible and then we get the benefits from using TS by simply getting extra check and making sure that not somewhere in our code we are kind of introducing a bug because us using wrong type.

## 3. Installing TypeScript

- In terminal, type `npm -g install typescript`.

## 4. Using TypeScript

- You can use TS with a file name ended with extension `.ts`.
- And run TS compiler with `tsc script.ts`
- This command line is essentially saying that compile this TS file to JS file.
- After run the command, when you check the folder, we will find the file that compiled to JS file.
