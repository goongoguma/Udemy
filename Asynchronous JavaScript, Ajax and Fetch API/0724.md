* What is an API?
-> Application Programming Interface
-> Contact provided by one pieve of software to another
-> Structured request and response
-> We just worked with an API that takes a request and responds with jokes

* What is REST APIS?
-> Representational State Transfer
-> Architecture style for designing networked applications
-> Relies on stateless, client-server protocol, almost always HTTP
-> Treats server objects as resources that can be created or destroyed
-> Can be used by virtually any programming language
-> All APIS have their own rules and structure

* HTTP Requests
-> GET : Retrieve data from a specified resource
-> POST : Submit data to be processed to a specified resource
-> PUT : Update a specified resource
-> DELETE : Delete a specified resource
-> HEAD : Same as GET but does not return a body
-> OPTIONS : Returns the supported HTTP methods
-> PATCH : Update partial resources
