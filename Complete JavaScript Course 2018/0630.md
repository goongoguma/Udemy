* What is the DOM?
-> it stands for Document Object Model
-> what it does? : DOM describes the structure of HTML document and the relationship between different elements such as attributes. Browers interpret and organize HTML as DOM and DOM allows them modify existing contents. Browsers translate and convert it into DOM.
-> Every tags and attributes, text I see in a code are known as Nodes in DOM.

* DOM Tree
-> First, we have HTML document and this is called 'Root Element' where everything starts. and HTML has children most of them are 'head' and 'body'. 'head' has 'title', 'meta', link children and 'body' has 'article' and 'nav' child and these also have children.
  * Relations example
  ul(Parent) -> li,li,li(Children and the relationship of three 'li' is called Sibilings and first 'li' is called first child and the last one is called last child and rest of them are called 'child nodes')

* Node Properties
-> nod.nodeName : the name
-> nod.nodeValue : the element inside
-> node.nodeType : the number value
-> node.attributes : list of node attributes
