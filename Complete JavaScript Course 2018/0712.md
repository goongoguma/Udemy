* Modules
-> Important aspect of any robust application's architecture
-> Keep the units of code for a project both cleanly seperated and organized
-> Encapsulate some data into privacy and expose other data publicly.
=> Modules allow us to break up the code into logical parts and then make them interact with one another.
=> *Module pattern returns an object containing all of the functions that we want to be public*


* TO-DO-LIST
1. Add event handler -> 2. Get input values -> 3. Add the new item to our data structure -> 4. Add the new item to the UI -> 5. Calculate budget -> 6. Update the UI

  * UI MODULE
  -> 2. Get input values
  -> 4. Add the new item to the UI
  -> 6. Update the UI

  * DATA MODULE
  -> 3. Add the new item to our data structure
  -> 5. Calculate budget

  * CONTROLLER MODULE
  -> 1. Add event handler

* Data Encapsulation
-> *Data Encapsulation allows us to hide the implementation details of a specific module from the outside scope so that we only expose a public interface which is sometimes called an API.*

* Separation of Concerns
-> Each part of the application should only be interested in doing one thing independently.
