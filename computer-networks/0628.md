* IP Address Components
  * An IP address is broken down into two parts 
    -> Network Address : Uniquely identifies each network(ex. Your Street Name: 7682 *Wilshire Drive*)
    -> Host Address : Uniquely identifies each machine on a network(ex. Your House Address: *7682* Wilshire Drive)
  * *Network Address + Host Address = IP Address* 

* Identifying Classes
First Octet         Address Class
  0 - 127               Class A
  128 - 191             Class B
  192 - 223             Class C

-> Type 'ping site-address' on cmd in order to check out IP address of the website you want to know 

* Private IP Addresses
-> Non-routable IP Addresses : If a router receives a private IP address, it will drop it
-> Uses Network Address Translation(NAT) to route traffic from network to network : Converts one address to another
-> IPv4 is inefficient and we are running out of IP addresses therefore we sub-setup these IP addresses and list them as non-routable IP addresses

* What is Subnetting?
-> *Subnet = Network : Subnet and network are interchangeable*
-> Subnetting is the process of breaking up Class A,B and C networks into smaller more manageable networks.
-> We borrow host bits to create more sub-networks for a Class A,B and C network.
-> When you borrow hosts bits, you increase the amount of sub-networks, aka Subnets available to you and decrease the amount of host IP addresses available to you.
-> Allows you to create multiple logical networks that exist within a single Class A, B or C network.
   (ex. break a major network down into multiple smaller sub-networks such as subnets)
-> If you don't subnet, you are only able to use one network from your Class A, B or C network, which is not realistic
