* OSI Layer 7 - Application Layer(Network Process to Application)
-> Where *users* communicate to the computer.
-> Acts as an *interface* between the application program and the *network*.
-> Provides an interface for I*nternet Explorer* or *Outlook* to communicate with the network. 
-> Applications *do not reside* in the application layer protocol, but instead interfaces with *application-layer protocols*.
-> Internet Explorer interfacing with HTTP protocol.
-> Application Layer is where you and application on your program are going to be interacting with application layer protocols that interface with the network.
(e.g.Internet Explorer is going to interface with protocol HTTP to get out to the Internet)

* OSI Layer 6 - Presentation Layer(Data Representation & Encryption)
-> Ensures that data transferred from one system's Application layer can be read by the Application layer on the another network
-> Character encoding : Acts as the translator and formatter (English Character, Korean Character, etc.)
-> *Application encryption* and decode as well (e.g.IE HTML converted to ASCII Format)

* OSI Layer 5 - Session Layer(Interhost Communication)
-> Resposible for *setting up*, *managing* and then *tearing down* sessions between Presentation-layer entities (you interacting on oneside and needing to communicate with presentation layer on some other side whether be server or be somebody else such as chatting session or loggin into a bank account via IE or Chrome)
-> Coordinates commnucation between systems (Start,Stop,Restart)
-> Starting, stopping and restarting your session from one side to the other

* OSI Layer 4 - The Tranport Layer(End-to-End Connections and Reliability)
-> The 'Post Office' Layer
  -> TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
  -> UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
  -> One of these protocols is selected and used to determine how we are going to send the data across the network
-> *Ensures that data arrives safely at its destination.*
-> We break up in *Segments* into pieces and reassembles data into a data stream (and we are using either TCP or UDP when we are doing this)

* OSI Layer 3 - The Network Layer(Path Determination & Logical Addressing(IP))
-> *The 'Routing' Layer*
-> *Provides addressing and routing sevices*
-> Places two addresses in the packet : Source Address & Destination Address
-> Internet Protocol(IP) : The primary network protocol used on the Internet, IPv4, IPv6 Logical Addresses

* OSI Layer 2 - Data Link Layer(Physical Addressing(MAC&LLC))
-> Provides physical transmission of the data
-> Ensures that messages are delivered to the proper device on a *LAN* using hardware addresses.
  -> MAC(Media Access Control) address
  -> The basic fundamental addressing on network to be able to send traffic from one device to another.
-> Translates messages from the Network layer into bits for the *Physical layer*.
-> *The 'switching' layer*. 
-> Switch uses MAC address to send information back and forth 
-> When we dealing with network, we dealing with routers and talking about communication in WAN. On the other hand, When we dealing with data link layer, we are talking about MAC addresses and seding data across LAN

* OSI Layer 1 - The Physical Layer(Media,Signal and Binary Transmission)
-> The physics of the network
  -> Sends bits and receives bits (1 or 0)
  -> Signaling, Cabling, connectors
  -> This layer is not about protocols
-> 'You have a physical layer problem.'
  -> Fix your *cabling*, *punch-downs*, etc.
  -> Testing and replacing cables
  -> Swapping *adapter cards*
-> A good foundation at the physical level is reuqired
