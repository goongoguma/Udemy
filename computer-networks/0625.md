* OSI Layer 7 - Application Layer(Network Process to Application) </br>
-> Where *users* communicate to the computer</br>
-> Acts as an *interface* between the application program and the *network*</br>
-> Provides an interface for *Internet Explorer* or *Outlook* to communicate with the network</br>
-> Applications *do not reside* in the application layer protocol, but instead interfaces with *application-layer protocols*</br>
-> Internet Explorer interfacing with HTTP protocol</br>
-> Application Layer is where you and application on your program are going to be interacting with application layer protocols that interface with the network</br>
(e.g.Internet Explorer is going to interface with protocol HTTP to get out to the Internet)</br>

* OSI Layer 6 - Presentation Layer(Data Representation & Encryption)</br>
-> Ensures that data transferred from one system's Application layer can be read by the Application layer on the another network</br>
-> Character encoding : Acts as the translator and formatter (English Character, Korean Character, etc.)</br>
-> *Application encryption* and decode as well (e.g.IE HTML converted to ASCII Format)</br>

* OSI Layer 5 - Session Layer(Interhost Communication)</br>
-> Resposible for *setting up*, *managing* and then *tearing down* sessions between Presentation-layer entities (you interacting on oneside and needing to communicate with presentation layer on some other side whether be server or be somebody else such as chatting session or loggin into a bank account via IE or Chrome)</br>
-> *Coordinates commnucation between systems (Start,Stop,Restart)*</br>
-> Starting, stopping and restarting your session from one side to the other</br>

* OSI Layer 4 - The Tranport Layer(End-to-End Connections and Reliability)</br>
-> The 'Post Office' Layer</br>
  -> TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</br>
  -> UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</br>
  -> One of these protocols is selected and used to determine how we are going to send the data across the network</br>
-> *Ensures that data arrives safely at its destination.*</br>
-> We break up in *Segments* into pieces and reassembles data into a data stream (and we are using either TCP or UDP when we are doing this)</br>

* OSI Layer 3 - The Network Layer(Path Determination & Logical Addressing(IP))</br>
-> *The 'Routing' Layer*</br>
-> *Provides addressing and routing sevices*</br>
-> Places two addresses in the packet : Source Address & Destination Address</br>
-> Internet Protocol(IP) : The primary network protocol used on the Internet, IPv4, IPv6 Logical Addresses</br>

* OSI Layer 2 - Data Link Layer(Physical Addressing(MAC&LLC))</br>
-> Provides physical transmission of the data</br>
-> Ensures that messages are delivered to the proper device on a *LAN* using hardware addresses</br>
  -> MAC(Media Access Control) address</br>
  -> The basic fundamental addressing on network to be able to send traffic from one device to another</br>
-> Translates messages from the Network layer into bits for the *Physical layer*</br>
-> *The 'switching' layer*</br>
-> Switch uses MAC address to send information back and forth </br>
-> When we dealing with network, we dealing with routers and talking about communication in WAN. On the other hand, When we dealing with data link layer, we are talking about MAC addresses and seding data across LAN</br>

* OSI Layer 1 - The Physical Layer(Media,Signal and Binary Transmission)</br>
-> The physics of the network</br>
  -> Sends bits and receives bits (1 or 0)</br>
  -> Signaling, Cabling, connectors</br>
  -> This layer is not about protocols</br>
-> 'You have a physical layer problem.'</br>
  -> Fix your *cabling*, *punch-downs*, etc.</br>
  -> Testing and replacing cables</br>
  -> Swapping *adapter cards*</br>
-> A good foundation at the physical level is reuqired</br>

* Data Encapsulation & Decapsulation</br>
  * Data encapsulation & decapsulation occur when data moves down and up the OSI model</br>
  * Encapsulation is when we add chunks of information to network data (IP,MAC,etc)</br>
    -> Occurs when we send data from a computer</br>
  * Decapsulation is when we remove chunks of information from network data when</br>
    -> Occurs when we recieve data at a computer</br>

* Data Encapsulation into the Protocol Layers</br>
-> Application Packet(Application Data) => TCP Packet(TCP Header + Application Data) => IP Packet(IP Header(source and destination of IP address) + TCP Header + Application Data) => Ethernet Packet (Ethernet Header(source and destination of MAC address) + IP Header + TCP Header + Application Data)</br>

* What is TCP/IP?</br>
-> A suite of Protocols</br>
-> Commonly called the Internet Protocol Suite because the Internet uses it</br>
-> First two Protocols defiend in the suite were : TCP&IP hence TCP/IP</br>
-> Similar to the OSI Model but simpler : OSI is conceptual, TCP/IP was actually implemented </br>
-> It has 5 layers (Application, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical/Network Access)</br>

* TCP/IP Protocols</br>
Layer -> Application, Transport, Network/Internet, Data Link, Physical/Network Access</br>
  * Application Protocols</br>
  -> FTP,TFTP,DNS,HTTP(S),TLS/SSL,VoIP(SIP,RTP),SSH,POP3,IMAP4,NTP,Telnet,SMTP,SNMP</br>
  * Transport Protocols</br>
  -> TCP,UDP</br>
  * Network / Internet Protocols</br>
  -> IP Addressing(Routing),ICMP,ARP</br>
  * Data Link Protocols</br>
  -> MAC Address(Switching)</br>
  * Physical/Network Access</br>
  -> Ethernet </br>

  => These protocols work together to provide *communication, management, diagnostics and troubleshooting* for a TCP/IP network. </br>

  * ARP(Address Resolution Protocol)</br>
  -> Resolves IP address to MAC Addresses </br>
  -> *Finds the hardware address(MAC address) of a host from a known IP address via Switch : And vice versa(RARP)*</br>
  -> Without ARP, nothing can communicate across the network</br>
  *ARP Command*</br>
  -> In order to find out ARP address of a computer, type 'arp -a' on cmd Administrator mode</br>
  -> If a computer knows an IP address but not the MAC address, it will send a broadcast message to all of the dvices on the LAN asking what device is assigned that IP address</br>

* Internet Protocol Version 4(IPv4)</br>
-> The primary Internet protocol</br>
-> Addresses and *transports data from one network node to another*</br>
-> 'The moving truck of the Internet'</br>
    : *Its job is to get data from one side of the Internet to the other*</br>
    : *Moves data back and forth throughout the Internet via routing*</br>
    : Looks at each packet's destination IP address, then uses a routing table to determine where to send it </br>
    : A connectionless protocol - 'fires and forgets'</br>
-> 32-bit(four byte) addresses</br>
    : 4,294,967,296 addresses</br>
    : Dotted-decimal notation -> 192.168.1.1</br>

* IP version 6(IPv6)</br>
-> The next generation Internet Protocol : Developed because we are running out of IPv4 addresses</br>
-> 128 bit addresses : complex hexadecimal format</br>
-> Improves routing, security, efficiency and more </br>

* ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol)</br>
-> Provides error checking and reporting functionality</br>
-> Sends management messages between systems : Echo Request/Echo Reply, Destination Unreachable</br>
-> *Great tool for troubleshooting a network*</br>
*Ping Command*</br>
-> Type ping 'address' on cmd</br>
