* MAC Addresses
-> Media Access Control(MAC)
-> Physical address of the network adapter card (unique identifier number that never gonna change)
-> OSI Layer 2 (Data Link) Layer address
-> TCP/IP Network Interface Layer address
-> MAC Addresse is physical address on the other hand IP address is logical address
-> we need to understand what layers they associate with
-> Six bytes(48bits), usually represnted hexadecimal
-> First three bytes(24bits) are assigned by the IEEE to the manufacturer (OUI assigned by IEEE)
-> Last three bytes(24bits) are usually assigned sequentially
-> In order to find out MAC Address of your computer, type 'ipconfig /all' in cmd (Physical Address indicates MAC Address of your computer)

* IPv4 Addresses
-> IP Address is a logical address that assigned to a network device by network itself
ex. 192.168.131 (Dotted Decimal Format masks Binary Format)
-> IP stands for 'Internet Protocol' 
-> Without IP, you won't be able to access network and internet
-> It is also identifiable using 'ipconfig /all' in cmd

* IP Addresses & MAC Addresses

- IP Addresses
-> Network(OSI Layer 3) Addresses
-> Logical Addresses (it changes based upon whatever network I am on)
-> Allows network-to-network(between networks) communication via routers (Distant *WAN* communication)
-> Dotted Decimal Notation : ex. 192.168.100.25

- MAC Addresses
-> Data Link(OSI Layer 2) Addresses
-> Physical Addresses (never gonna change)
-> Physically burned on NIC
-> Allows *internetwork*(one specifc network) communication via hubs, switches and routers(Local *LAN* communication)
