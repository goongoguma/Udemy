* MAC Addresses </br>
-> Media Access Control(MAC)</br>
-> Physical address of the network adapter card (unique identifier number that never gonna change)</br>
-> OSI Layer 2 (Data Link) Layer address</br>
-> TCP/IP Network Interface Layer address</br>
-> MAC Addresse is physical address on the other hand IP address is logical address</br>
-> we need to understand what layers they associate with</br>
-> Six bytes(48bits), usually represnted hexadecimal</br>
-> First three bytes(24bits) are assigned by the IEEE to the manufacturer (OUI assigned by IEEE)</br>
-> Last three bytes(24bits) are usually assigned sequentially</br>
-> In order to find out MAC Address of your computer, type 'ipconfig /all' in cmd (Physical Address indicates MAC Address of your computer)</br>

* IPv4 Addresses</br>
-> IP Address is a logical address that assigned to a network device by network itself</br>
ex. 192.168.131 (Dotted Decimal Format masks Binary Format)</br>
-> IP stands for 'Internet Protocol' </br>
-> Without IP, you won't be able to access network and internet</br>
-> It is also identifiable using 'ipconfig /all' in cmd</br>

* IP Addresses & MAC Addresses</br>

- IP Addresses</br>
-> Network(OSI Layer 3) Addresses</br>
-> Logical Addresses (it cMAhanges based upon whatever network I am on)</br>
-> Allows network-to-network(between networks) communication via routers (Distant *WAN* communication)</br>
-> Dotted Decimal Notation : ex. 192.168.100.25</br>

- MAC Addresses</br>
-> Data Link(OSI Layer 2) Addresses</br>
-> Physical Addresses (never gonna change)</br>
-> Physically burned on NIC</br>
-> Allows *internetwork*(one specifc network) communication via hubs, switches and routers(Local *LAN* communication)</br>
