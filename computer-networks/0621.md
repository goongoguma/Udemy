* MAC Addresses </br>
-> Media Access Control(MAC)</br>
-> Physical address of the network adapter card (unique identifier number that never gonna change)</br>
-> OSI Layer 2 (Data Link) Layer address</br>
-> TCP/IP Network Interface Layer address</br>
-> MAC Addresse is physical address on the other hand IP address is logical address</br>
-> we need to understand what layers they associate with</br>
-> Six bytes(48bits), usually represnted hexadecimal</br>
-> First three bytes(24bits) are assigned by the IEEE to the manufacturer (OUI assigned by IEEE)</br>
-> Last three bytes(24bits) are usually assigned sequentially</br>
-> In order to find out MAC Address of your computer, type 'ipconfig /all' in cmd (Physical Address indicates MAC Address of your computer)</br>

* IP Addresses</br>
-> IP Address is a logical address that assigned to a network device by network itself</br>
ex. 192.168.131 (Dotted Decimal Format masks Binary Format)</br>
-> IP stands for 'Internet Protocol' </br>
-> Without IP, you won't be able to access network and internet</br>
-> It is also identifiable using 'ipconfig /all' in cmd</br>

* IP Addresses & MAC Addresses</br>

- IP Addresses</br>
-> Network(OSI Layer 3) Addresses</br>
-> Logical Addresses (it changes based upon whatever network I am on)</br>
-> Allows network-to-network(between networks) communication via routers (Distant *WAN* communication)</br>
-> Dotted Decimal Notation : ex. 192.168.100.25</br>

- MAC Addresses</br>
-> Data Link(OSI Layer 2) Addresses</br>
-> Physical Addresses (never gonna change)</br>
-> Physically burned on NIC</br>
-> Allows *internetwork*(one specifc network) communication via hubs, switches and routers(Local *LAN* communication)</br>

* Local Area Network(LAN)
-> A Local Area Network(LAN) is a collection of computers and other networked devices that fit within the scope of a *single physical network*.
-> *Usually restricted to a particular geographic region.*
-> ex. office building, single department within a corporate office, home office and classroom.

* Wide Area Network(WAN)
-> A Wide Area Network(WAN) is an internetwork that connects *multiple sites* and spans large geographic regions. (Multiple different locations connected to together)
-> Usually employ both routers and public links(publicly listed link inter-connect to the internet to get to another sites such and san-fransico office connecting to the dallas office)
-> ex. Internet, the different building on campus, etc.
-> Unlike a WAN, a LAN may reside in only a single location
-> Multiple LANs = 1 WAN

* Peer-to-Peer Architecture(P2P)
-> All computers on the network are peers
-> *No Dedicated Servers*
-> There is *no centralized control over shared resources*
-> Any individual machine can share its resources as it pleases
-> All computers on the network can act as either a client(receive resources) or a server(privide resources)

  * Advantages
  -> Easy to *install and configure*
  -> Does not depend on the presence of a dedicated server
  -> *Indivisual users control their own shared resources*
  -> *Inexpensive* to purchase and operate
  -> *No dedicated administrators* are needed to run the network.

  * Disadvantages
  -> *Network security* applies only to a single resource at a time 
  -> Users may be forced to use as many *passwords* as there are shared resources
  -> *Each machine must be backed up individually to protect all shared data*
  -> There is no *centralized organizational scheme* to locate or control access to data
