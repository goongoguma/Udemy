* Transport Layer Protocols </br>
  * Transmission Control Protocols (TCP)</br>
  * User Datagram Protocols (UDP)</br>
=> Two protocols determine how we want to send a data and how reliable the data want it to be when we send it</br>

* TCP (Transmission Control Protocols)</br>
-> Connection-Oriented : 3-Way Handshake, SYN -> SYN/ACK -> ACK, Reliable delivery, Virtual connection between 2 devices</br>
  (e.g. SYN from you to Gmail -> SYN/ACK from Gmail to you -> ACK from you to Gmail)</br>
-> Assures delivery of packets through error-checking (data sequencing)</br>

* UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</br>
-> A scaled-down, economic version of TCP</br>
-> Connectionless & Unreliable</br>
-> No Data Retransmissions</br>
-> "Best effort" (I did my best. I have sent the data, hopefully it gets there if it doesn't, there is nothing I can do about it)</br>
-> Used a lot for streaming real-time data : VoIP, video streams, audio streams </br>

* TCP VS UDP</br>
-> With reliabliity and assurance, comes a cost. TCP packets are much larger than UDP Packets, therefore they take more bandwidth.</br>
-> If you want to reliably deliver IP packets : Use TCP (ex. File transfers or FireFox Online Banking Web Sessions)</br>
-> If you want fast, economical IP packet delivery : Use UDP (ex. Voice over IP Phone Call)</br>
-> Certain protocols and applications use TCP, while others use UDP</br>

* TCP/IP Application Layer Protocols</br>
-> Management Protocols : DNS, SNMP, NTP</br>
-> Remote Authentication Protocols : Telnet, SSH</br>
-> Mail Application Protocols : SMTP, POP3, IMAP4</br>
-> Browser Protocols : HTTP, HTTPS, TLS/SSL</br>
-> Voice over IP(VoIP) Protocols : SIP, RTP</br>

  * Management Protocols</br>
  -> DNS(Domain Name Services) : Converts domain name to IP addresses, Google.com -> 74.125.224.52, NSLOOKUP Command(type 'nslookup domain name' in cmd)</br>
  -> NTP(Network Time Protocol) : Automatically synchronized clocks on network devices </br>
  -> SNMP(Simple Network Management Protocol) : SNMPv1 / SNMPv2 / SNMPv3 , Collects and manipulates network information, Used for network management and maintenance(v1 -> The original,clear text data, v3 -> Encrypted data )</br>

  * Remote Communication Protocols</br>
    * Telnet - Telecommunication Network(*TCP*)</br>
    -> *Provides a virtual terminal protocol logging into and managing devices*</br>
    -> Not used often anymore because unencrypted communication</br>
    * SSH - Secure Shell(*TCP*)</br>
    -> Looks and acts like Telnet but *communication is encrypted*</br>
    -> puTTY SSH Client Popular</br>

  * File Transfer Application Protocols</br>
    * FTP - File Transfer Protocol(*TCP*)</br>
    -> *Transfer files between systems*</br>
    -> Authentications with a username and password</br>
    -> Full-featured functionality(list, add, deleted, upload, download etc.)</br>
    -> ex. FileZilla FTP Client </br>
    * TFTP - Trivial File Transfer Protocol(*UDP*)</br>
    -> Very simple file transfer application</br>
    -> Can send and receive files; no directory browsing</br>
    -> No authentication</br>
    
  * Mail Application Protocols</br>
    * SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocols(TCP)</br>
    -> Used most often for sending mail</br>
    -> Transferring between mail servers</br>
    * POP3 - Post Office Protocol version 3(TCP)</br>
    -> Receive email</br>
    -> Deliver emails from the mail server to my client machine</br>
    -> Designed for intermittent connectivity (only going to query and send request to mail server whenever I ask to it)</br>
    * IMAP4 - Internet Message Access Protocol v4(TCP)</br>
    -> Another mail client protocol</br>
    -> Allows users to access email on servers and either read the email on the server or downlad the email to the client machine.</br>
       (ex. Looking at my emails on a server itself)</br>

  * Browser Application Protocols</br>
    * HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol(TCP)</br>
    -> Provides for browsing services for the www</br>
    * HTTPS - Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure(TCP)</br>
    -> Provides for access to resources on the Internet in a secure fashion.</br>
    -> *Encryption via TLS/SSL*</br>
    * TLS/SSL - Transport Layer Serucity & Secure Socket Layer(TCP)</br>
    -> *Cryptographic protocols* for enabling secure online data-transfer activities.</br>
    -> TLS has replaced SSL</br>
  
  * Voice over IP(VoIP) Protocols</br>
    * SIP - Session Initiation Protocol(TCP)</br>
    -> Sets up and tears down voice and video calls over the Internet</br>
    * RTP - Real-Time Transport Protocol(UDP)</br>
    -> *The standard for delivering audio and video over the Internet. Commonly employed for streaming media, video, conferencing and VoIP.* </br>
    * *Will commonly use reliable TCP to set-up and manage the session but UDP to send the real-time data.* </br>
