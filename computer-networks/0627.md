* Why we need Ports?</br>
-> Computers require ports because of network application mutitasking</br>
-> Ports allow you to associate packets with TCP/IP protocols</br>
-> Network Services are assigned a Port Number : DNS, HTTP, SMTP, FTP, POP3, TELNET etc</br>
-> Because a computer has 1 IP and MAC address, it needs ports to differentiate network protocols and services </br>
    : Web-Browsing -> HTTP TCP Port 80</br>
    : E-mail -> SMTP TCP Port 25 & POP3 TCP Port 110</br>
-> Firewalls filter network traffic by port numbers</br>
-> TCP/IP has 65,536 ports available </br>

* Well known ports</br>
-> Approximately 65,536 ports available</br>
-> Ports reserved for common TCP/IP protocols</br>
    : Well Known ports (All the different TCP/IP protocol numbers are reserved in the computer)</br>
    : Well Known port numbers < 1024 (Number under 1024 is already pre-assigned)</br>

* Ports in Action</br>
-> Communication originates from your computer utilizing a *high random port* to communicate across a LAN / WAN / Internet to communicate with a remote server, in this case a web server. The Web server will be listening in on specific ports for its associated TCP/IP protocols.</br>
-> You send a request with associated port number(ex.TCP/1351) and when they get the request, they send back to your temporarliy assigned your port number </br>
-> Port numbers are assigned to different protocols so we can do multi-tasking on networks because we have different applications and multiple protocols open and we have only have one MAC and IP address so we need to assign these protocols to specific port numbers.</br>

* IP & MAC Addresses Reviewed
  * IP Addresses</br>
  -> Network(OSI Layer 3) Addresses</br>
  -> *Logical Addresses*</br>
  -> Allows network-to-network communication via routers</br>
  -> WAN communication : Routing</br>
  -> *Dotted Decimal Notation : 192.168.100.25*</br>
</br>
  * MAC Addresses</br>
  -> Data Link(OSI Layer 2) Addresses</br>
  -> *Physical Addresses*</br>
  -> Allows internetwork communication via hubs, switches and routers</br>
  -> LAN communication : Switching</br>
  -> *Physically burned on NIC*</br>
</br>
* IPv4 Addresses</br>
-> Internet Protocol version 4 : OSI Layer3 (Network) address</br>
-> Dotted Decimal Format masks Binary Format</br>
