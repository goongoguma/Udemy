* Client/Server Architecture</br>
-> Network is composed of *clients and servers*</br>
-> Servers provided centralized control over network resources, i.e. files, printers, authentication, etc.</br>
-> Clients *receive resources*</br>
-> Servers *provide resources*</br>

  * Advantages</br>
  -> Centralized user accounts, *security*, and access controls to *simply network administration* (It provides great security)</br>
  -> More powerful servers equate to *more efficient* access to network resources, *scales up* more efficiently than peer-to-peer (a lot faster than P2P)</br>
  -> A *single password* for network logon delivers access to all resources (Everybody has access one login to all the resources on the network)</br>

  * Disadvantages</br>
  -> *Server failure* renders a network unusable or results in *loss of network resources*</br>
  -> *Complex*, special-purpose server software requires allocation of *expert staff*</br>
  -> Dedicated hardware and specialized software add to the *cost of ownership* (Smaller businesses can't afford it)</br>
